# Sandbox Key Generator
A website for generating totally real sandbox keys. Now uses TypeScript so I can pretend I know what I'm doing.

This key generator is 100 times more advanced than [Skadz's implementation](https://keys.skadz.online/)... or anyone else's, for that matter.
## Usage
Build using the following instructions, or use the hosted version at [https://sbox-sandcastle.github.io/qxxst-keygen](https://sbox-sandcastle.github.io/qxxst-keygen).
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Node.js.
3. Run `npm install` to install TypeScript.
4. Run `npx tsc` to compile TypeScript files into JavaScript.
5. Open `index.html` in your browser.
